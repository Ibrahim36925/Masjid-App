    <p className='kosher-p-1'><b>Kosher</b></p>
    <p className='kosher-p-2'>Kosher is from the Hebrew word kasher, which means "fit" and "proper". The term is usually used for food that Jews are permitted to eat under dietary laws that are derived from passages in the biblical books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy.<br/><br/>Some elements of Jewish and Islamic dietary laws are common,while some are not.Here are a couple of major differences<br/><br/>* Kosher laws do not require Jews to pronounce the name of God at the time of slaughter.On the other hand, Muslims are required to recite the name of Allah at the time of slaughter. For this reason,Muslims are not allowed to consume Kosher meat. For more information,please see the 'Zabihah' section at eat-halal.com.<br/><br/>* Jews are allowed to consume many types of alcohol,while Muslims must abstain from all forms of intoxicants,including alcohol.<br/><br/>It must be noted that <b>if a product is Kosher certified, it does not mean that the product is automatically Halal.</b>While it is true that Kosher certification can be used as a tool for eating Halal,one must be very careful. There are Kosher certification agencies which certify products and ingredients which are not considered Kosher by many Jews.</p>

    <p className='kosher-p-3'>The following are updates regarding Kosher which were previously sent out by eat-halal.com:</p>
    <p className='kosher-p-4'><b><i>No animal rennet currently being used in MK certified products</i></b></p>
    <p className='kosher-p-5'>(October 28,2001) The Jewish Community Council of Montreal has told eat-halal.com that no animal rennet is used in products certified by them. Products certified kosher by the Council are marked with MK and a circle around it. The rennet used in the whey in MK certified products is also from a non-animal source. Rennet from Kosher animals may be used in MK certified products in the feature, but the Council has agreed to inform us when that occurs. This means that the rennet and whey currently being used in MK certified products are Halal. The Jewish Community Council of Montreal may be reached at (514) 739-6363.  </p>
    <p className='kosher-p-6'><b><i>Most COR certified products free of animal rennet</i></b></p>

    <p className='zabihah-p-1 '><b>Zabihah</b></p>
    <p className='zabihah-p-2'>Animals such as cows, sheep, goats, deer, moose, chickens, ducks, game birds, etc., are also Halal, but they must be Zabihah (slaughtered according to Islamic Law) in order for their meat to be suitable for consumption. The procedure is as follows: the animal must be slaughtered by a Muslim. The animal should be put down on the ground (or held it if it is small) and its throat should be slit with a very sharp knife to make sure that the three main blood vessels are cut. While cutting the throat of the animal (without severing it), the slaughterer must pronounce the name of Allah or recite a blessing which contains the name of Allah, such as "Bismillah Allah-u-Akbar".</p>
    <p className='zabihah-p-3'><b><i>Why does the animal have to be slaughtered by a Muslim? Can't we eat the meat of animals slaughtered by the People of the Book (Jews and Christians)?</i></b></p>
     <p className='zabihah-p-4'>Allah Taala says in the Noble Quran:<br/><br/>Today I have made permissible for you pure things and the food of those who were given the Book (Ahlul-Kitaab) is also Halal for you'. (Quran 5:4)<br/><br/>Overtly the above Aayat reads that the Zabihah of the Ahlul-Kitaab (People of the Book) is permissible, but the fundamental principle must be understood in order to understand the Quran I.e. 'One part of the Quran explains the other'. Therefore, this verse should be understood in the light of another verse relating to the same matter: 'Do not eat unless Allah's name has been taken and this (not taking Allah's name) practice is transgression' (Quran 6:121)<br/><br/>While the former verse explicitly states that the Zabihah of the Ahlul-Kitaab is permissible and the latter says, 'Do not eat unless Allah's name has been taken', in the light of both these verses, it is understood that the Zabihah of the Ahlul-kitaab is permissible only if the name of Allah is taken at the time of slaughtering. The Ahlul-kitaab used to take Allah's name when. slaughtering an animal, therefore, their Zabihah was also Halal for Muslims. It is for this same reason that an animal slaughtered by the Mushrikeen (polytheists), etc. Is not permissible. The Ahlul-kitaab of today are recognized by name, less faith. There is no guarantee that they take the name of Allah/God when slaughtering an animal. Furthermore, they cannot be anymore trusted in matters pertaining to Halal/Haram.<br/><br/>Since there is uncertainty in the above slaughter manner, the Jurists are unanimous that it is not permissible to consume meat which is doubtful. Unless there is certainty that the Ahlul-kitaab read the 'Tasmiyah' i.e. take the name of God when slaughtering an animal then only will the meat be permissible. We suggest that the Muslims in the U.S.A. and U.K. slaughter the animals themselves. A committee be appointed and look into ways to facilitate for Halal meat slaughtered by Muslims. This will make them independent from Christian/Jewish sources.<br/><br/>Another proposition may be that the meat sold on the market are packed, sealed and stampedby a Muslim organization consisting of reliable scholars and Ulama whoâ have proper Islamic<br/>Knowledge of the principles pertaining to Halal/Haram of the Shariah (Islamic Law).<br/><br/>and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best<br/><br/></p>
